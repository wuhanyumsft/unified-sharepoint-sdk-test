      Number of full days difference between current clock and homeZone clock

      IMPORTANT: depends on time of the day by design.

      Example: difference between 1 am and 11pm of the previous day would be 1.

      Difference between 9pm and 11pm would be 0.

      Then it gets converted by our LocaleFormat to a locale-specific string
      representation.
