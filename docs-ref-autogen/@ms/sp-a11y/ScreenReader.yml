      Make screen reader read a message to the user. This is done by adding a
      new element to the document that has

      'role' attribute set to 'true'. It gets an id for the message to avoid
      cluttering the document with new elements.

      If a message element with the given id has been already added, it will be
      cleaned up before adding a new element.

      Therefore, an application usually needs just one unique id to pass to all
      invocations of this method.

      The element is hidden by default, but this can be configured via isVisible
      parameter. Additionally, the caller can

      pass a className to be added to the element.
    syntax:
      content: >-
        static function alert(id: string, message: string, isVisible: boolean,
        className?: string)
      parameters:
        - id: id
          type:
            - string
          description: >-
            A string identifier passed by the caller. It should be unique per
            application.
        - id: message
          type:
            - string
          description: The message to be read by the screen reader
        - id: isVisible
          type:
            - boolean
          description: >-
            Whether the element added to the document should be visible.
            Defaults to false.
