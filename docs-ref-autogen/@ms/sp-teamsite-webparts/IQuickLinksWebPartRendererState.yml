      Use this key to enforce re-construction of React components.

      Change on any of the props (E.g. replace a provider) will make the
      components inconsistent with its data source.

      We need unmount and mount the components if the reference of
      provider/dispatcher/menuActionFactory changes.

      That usually means the data storage model for this webpart is changed.

      We need to make sure every component is turned into a fresh state when
      storage model is changed.

      The references of props other than provider/dispatcher/menuActionFactory
      are not supposed to be changed at runtime.
