      BingMapVirtualPushPin component is for accessibility and not visible on
      the view.

      It mocks the focus behavior of actual unfocusable push pin.

      When focus is on virtual push pin, it:
       in edit mode: triggers the style change of the correspoding actual pushpin.
                     provides the focused pin information for the screen reader.
                     reminds the user to press enter to configure the push pin.
       in view mode: The same as in edit mode, except for not supporting press enter to configure.
