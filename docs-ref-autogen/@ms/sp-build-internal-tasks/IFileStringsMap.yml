      Represents a mapping of files (file hashes or paths) to StringsMap

      This is the same format as the localized strings bundles once they are in
      production

      {
        "_hfhjkdh7324": {
          helloWorld: "Hello, World!"
        }
      }

      or

      {
        "_hfhjkdh7324": {
          helloWorld: {
            value: "Hello, World!",
            comment: "A common greeting used by programmers"
          }
