      The CoverageReporter class converts the raw coverage data generated by
      'istanbul' and 'remap-istanbul'

      to file code coverage report and code churn coverage report used by build
      task - 'VerifyCoverageTask'.

      It will ignore the files that match the 'skipPatterns' defined in
      VerifyCoverageTask

      and 'skipFoldersOrFiles' defined in 'verify-coverage.json' under the
      config folder of each sub project.


      The code churn info is generated based on the output of 'git diff'. If git
      doesn't exist in the system,

      'VerifyCoverageTask' will skip the code churn coverage report generation.
