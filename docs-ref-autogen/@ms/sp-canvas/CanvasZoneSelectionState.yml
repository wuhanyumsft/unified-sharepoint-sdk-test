      The CanvasZone object can be in several states with regard to selection.

      Precedence is important since it can happen for example that the zone is
      both Focused and Active in which

      case Active would be chosen because it has higher precedence.

      None

      Active - a control inside the zone is Selected

      Selected - the zone itself is selected
