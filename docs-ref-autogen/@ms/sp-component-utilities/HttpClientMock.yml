      This class encapsulates the details of creating a mock http client, thus
      providing

      an easier way to create a mocked http client and define the expectations
      to it, in the

      context of the file picker.

      Since POST calls to http client automatically fetch the digest if it's not
      present in the request headers,

      this may become tricky to test because the first call that would be done
      would be a call to fetch the digest,

      thus failing the expectation that has been set. In order to obtain a
      consistent and predictable behavior

      this methods clears the digest cache and sets an expectation for a digest
      call.
