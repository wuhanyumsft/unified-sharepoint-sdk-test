      This interface specifies the set of properties that can be pre-configured
      by a Web Part developer. Each

      pre-configured instance of the Web Part will need a copy of these
      properties. Organization admins and

      content authors can modify these properties on a need basis.

      Definition: Use this field to specify the data version of the
      pre-configured data provided to the web part.
       Note that data version is different from the version field in the manifest. The manifest version
       is used to control the versioning of the web part code, while data version is used to control the versioning of
       the serialized data of the web part. Refer to dataVersion field of your web part for more information.
      Usage: versioning and evolving the serialized data of the web part

      Definition: every Web Part is expected to have some custom properties.
      e.g. an image Web Part may have the image
       url and caption text as custom properties, a list Web Part may have the list id and list title as custom
       properties, and so on. The Web Part framework is transparent to these properties. It just acts as a conduit to
       pass these properties in and out to the Web Parts. The Web Part developer fully controls the schema of these
       properties. The Web Part developer should follow versioning rules (@todo: pointer to Web Part versioning document)
       to evolve these properties.
      Usage: rendering of the Web Part.
