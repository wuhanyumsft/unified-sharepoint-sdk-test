      This is the interface for a script module with the "localizedPath" type.
      Modules of this type must be provided by the
       component developer. These script resources are similar to those of the "path" type, but they may be present
       at a number of different paths, to be selected by the user's locale. Paths in this module type are loaded exactly
       the same way as "internal" modules are.

      Definition: A path to this module's default locale javascript resource
      either as a fully-qualified URL or as a
       path under the paths provided in the "internalModuleBaseUrls" field. If the user's locale does not resolve to one
       of the paths specified in the "paths" field, the path in this field is used. Paths in this module type are
       treated exactly the same way paths in modules of the "internal" type are treated.
      Required: yes

      Localized: no

      Supported values: The path to the default locale version of the module
      either as a fully-qualified URL or as a path
       under the paths provided in the "internalModuleBaseUrls" field.
      Example: "master_2015-04-20/my-application_strings_default_af378e0d.js"
    syntax:
      content: string defaultPath
      return:

      Definition: This is a dictionary of locale keys (in the "ll-cc" format) to
      paths to this module's locale
       javascript resource either as a fully-qualified URL or as a path under the paths provided in the
       "internalModuleBaseUrls" field. The loader will attempt to resolve the user's locale to one of the paths provided
       by this field, and will load the script resource under that path. If the user's locale does not resolve to one
       of the paths specified in this field, the path in "defaultPath" field is used. For example, if the user's locale
       is "en-gb", and this field's value contains the keys [ "en-us", "en-gb", "fr-fr" ], the path specified by the
       "en-gb" key will be used. If the user's locale is "en-gb", and this field's value contains the keys [ "en-us",
       "fr-fr" ], the path specified by the "en-us" key will be used. If the user's locale is "en-gb", and this field's
       value contains the keys [ "es-es", "fr-fr" ], the path specified by the "defaultPath" field will be used.
       Paths in this module type are treated exactly the same way paths in modules of the "internal" type are treated.
      Required: no

      Localized: no

      Supported values: A dictionary of locale-to-path mappings.

      Example:
       {
         "en-us": "master_2015-04-20/my-application_strings_en-us_d38ff012.js",
         "fr-fr": "master_2015-04-20/my-application_strings_fr-fr_138af7e4.js"
       }
    syntax:
      content: '[key: string]: function paths'
      return:
        type:
          - '[key: string]: function'
