      This interface defines the options for the SPHttpClient operations such as
      get(), post(), fetch(), etc.  It is based on the WHATWG API standard
      parameters that are documented here:

    remarks: |-
      For a write operation, SPHttpClient will automatically add the
      "X-RequestDigest" header, which may need to be fetched using a seperate
      request such as "https://example.com/sites/sample/_api/contextinfo".
      Typically the SPWeb URL ("https://example.com/sites/sample" in this
      example) can be guessed by looking for a reserved URL segment such
      as "_api" in the original REST query, however certain REST endpoints
      do not contain a reserved URL segment; in this case, the webUrl can
      be explicitly specified using this option.
