      SPHttpClientBatch will need to perform its POST to an endpoint such as
      "http://example.com/sites/sample/_api/$batch". Typically the SPWeb URL
      ("https://example.com/sites/sample" in this example) can be guessed by
      looking for a reserved URL segment such as "_api" in the first URL
      passed to fetch(), but if not, the webUrl can be explicitly specified
      using this option.

      content: string webUrl
