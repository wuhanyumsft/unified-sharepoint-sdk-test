    remarks: >-
      This interface provides standard predefined SPHttpClientConfiguration
      objects for use with

      the SPHttpClient class.  In general, clients should choose the latest
      available

      version number, which enables all the switches that are recommended for
      typical

      scenarios.  (If new switches are introduced in the future, a new version
      number

      will be introduced, which ensures that existing code will continue to
      function the

      way it did at the time when it was tested.)
