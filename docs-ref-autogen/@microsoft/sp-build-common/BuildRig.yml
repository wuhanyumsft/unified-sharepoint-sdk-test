      Represents a gulp-core-build build "rig", or a collection of tasks and

      configurations. It can be extended to define more top-level configurable
      tasks,

      inject subtasks into the chain, register arguments to the command line.

      This class represents all the logic which doesn't belong in a rig, and
      should instead

      be a part of gulp-core-build. Thus, this class should be removed once that
      logic

      is properly replicated in gulp-core-build.
