      This structure is used to define metadata for web part properties as a map
      of string to IWebPartPropertyMetadata

    remarks: >-
      The key should be a JSON path to the property in web part properties. The
      JSON path supports the following operators:


      - Dot . for selecting object members e.g. person.name


      - Brackets [] for selecting array items e.g. person.photoURLs[0]


      - Bracketed asterisk [*] for array elements wildcard e.g.
      person.websites[*].


      You can make combinations of these operators e.g. person.websites[*].url

      Important Note: Only one wildcard per path is supported.


      Example: Let's assume we have a web part with properties that have the
      following schema:

      {
        title: string;
        person: {
          name: string;
          bio: string;
          photoURLs: string[];
          websites: { title: string; url: string; }[]
        }
      }


      We can define the metadata for the desired properties as following:

      {
       'person.bio': { isRichContent: true },
       'person.photoURLs[*]': { isImageSource: true },
       'person.websites[*].url': { isLink: true }
      }


      This will make SharePoint servers aware of the content of your properties
      and run services such as search indexing,

      link fix-up, etc on the data. In case any of the values needs to update by
      these services, e.g link fix-up, the

      web part property bag is automatically updated.
