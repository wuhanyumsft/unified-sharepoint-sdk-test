      This structure represents the part of the serialized state of a web part
      which is controlled by the web part.

      It is extended by IWebPartData which contains additional data added by the
      framework to the serialized data.

    remarks: >-
      Note that data version is different from the version field in the
      manifest.

      The manifest version is used to control the versioning of the web part
      code, while data version is used to

      control the versioning of the serialized data of the web part. Refer to
      dataVersion field of your web part

      for more information.


      Usage: versioning and evolving the serialized data of the web part

      Required: yes

      Type: Version

      Supported values: MAJOR.MINOR

      Paths for the dynamic data. This is used to reconstruct the dynamic data

      The key is the path within the web part properties, and the value is the
      dynamic data internal id.

      Required: no

      Supported values: Map from string to string
