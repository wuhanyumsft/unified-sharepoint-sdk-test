      This is a newer version of TestWebPart. To keep it simple, its properties
      are an extended version of

      TestWebPart properties and it overrides dataVersion property to reflect
      that it has a new data schema.

      On deserialization, it checks the data versions and handles some upgrading
      scenarios
