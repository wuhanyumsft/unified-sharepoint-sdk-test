    deprecated:
      content: |-
        This interface will be removed in an upcoming release.  Use the
        <xref:WebPartContext> class instead.
    remarks: |-
      A "context" object is a collection of well-known services and other
      objects that are likely to be needed by any business logic working with
      a component.  Each component type has its own specialized extension of
      this interface, e.g. IWebPartContext for web parts, IExtensionContext for
      client-side extensions, etc.
