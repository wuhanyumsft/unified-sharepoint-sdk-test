      This flag instructs framework to store the value as HTML, so that
      SharePoint can perform the following

      services on it:

      - normalizing HTML encodings

      - stripping unsafe HTML tags (i.e. for usage with Element.innerHTML)

      - search indexing

      - SharePoint link fix-up


      Only enable this flag for HTML content where these modifications are
      acceptable. If non-HTML content is

      provided, SharePoint framework might make modifications to convert it to
      HTML valid. For plain text content

      that simply needs to be exposed to the search index (without any
      rewriting), use the isSearchablePlainText

      flag instead.

    remarks: >-
      This flag instructs the framework to store the property in a
      representation that supports search indexing.

      The content will be treated as plain text; SharePoint will not modify the
      string in any way, and

      special HTML characters may be stored encoded and appear in search
      results. If your string contains

      HTML markup, use the isHtmlString setting instead.

      Security note: For security reasons, never assign a plain text string to
      Element.innerHTML.
