      This structure represents the serialized state of a web part. When the
      serialize() API is called on

      a web part, the output should be this structure. The structure of the
      'properties' field is owned by the

      web part and is specific to the web part. Each web part can decide the set
      of properties it wants to

      serialialize.

      Definition: Web part data version. Note that data version is different
      from the version field in the manifest.
       The manifest version is used to control the versioning of the web part code, while data version is used to
       control the versioning of the serialized data of the web part. Refer to dataVersion field of your web part
       for more information.
      Usage: versioning and evolving the serialized data of the web part
