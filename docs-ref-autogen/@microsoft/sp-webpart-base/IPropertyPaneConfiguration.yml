      This feature is intended to be used when the user is waiting on a promise
      to resolve.

      If set to true, overlay loading indicator appears after 500ms (web part
      author can override this behavior by

      using overlayLoadingIndicator property).


      The reason why we are not showing it immediately is that our intent is to
      never show the loading

      indicator. But in real life async requests could take long and it becomes
      necessary to display a

      loading indicator to the end user.
