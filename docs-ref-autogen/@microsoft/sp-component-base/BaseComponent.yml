      Each client-side component has an associated manifest that is used by the
      sp-loader to load its scripts,

      and which may include additional metadata about the component.  The
      manifest is uniquely identified using

      a text string containing a lower case GUID value.

    remarks: >-
      Third-party code generally does not need to call this method; it's invoked

      automatically when the lifecycle ends for a web part or extension.  To
      perform

      custom cleanup when your component is disposed, override the
      <xref:BaseComponent.onDispose>

      method.

      A component implementation can be loaded multiple times on the page.

      For example, if the component is a charting web part, multiple instances
      of this web part

      could be added to the SharePoint canvas.  The instanceId uniquely
      identifies each

      of these instances.
