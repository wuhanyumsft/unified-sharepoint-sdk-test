      This is the base class that third parties should extend when implementing

      a client-side extension that runs when an application is first starting.

      In the component manifest, the "extensionType" should be set to
      "ApplicationCustomizer".

      Example usage scenarios for an application customizer might include:
      rendering custom

      UI elements inside a SharePoint content placeholder, tracking page load
      statistics,

      or automatically logging the user out after a certain time period.
