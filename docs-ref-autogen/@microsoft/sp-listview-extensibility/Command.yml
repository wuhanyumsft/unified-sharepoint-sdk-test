    remarks: >-
      The BaseListViewCommandSet extension type exposes generalized commands
      that may be displayed as tool bar buttons,

      context menu items, etc. These commands are initially defined in the
      extension’s manifest file. At runtime, the

      corresponding Command object can be obtained by calling
      <xref:BaseListViewCommandSet.tryGetCommand>.

      The command’s appearance can be customized by assigning its properties,
      for example to hide a command that is not

      contextually relevant, or to pluralize the title based on the number of
      selected items.

      Altering the title property is intended to allow minor changes to the
      title, e.g. “Submit these 3 items” or

      toggling between “Schedule” and “Unschedule”. Developers are discouraged
      from assigning a title that radically

      alters the meaning of the command, because administrators should be able
      to examine the extension manifest to

      understand which commands are being implemented by a given extension.
