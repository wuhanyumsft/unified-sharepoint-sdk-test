      Blocked: The component does not work with this browser.

      The SharePoint Framework will prevent the page from rendering, instead
      displaying the supplied warning message.

      This a very poor experience for the end user. Only use this level for
      situations where it is absolutely certain

      that the page will fail to render, and it is not feasible to implement a
      workaround.
