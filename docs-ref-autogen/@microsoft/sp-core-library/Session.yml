      A unique identifier used to correlate logging and other diagnostic
      information. Its lifetime

      persists for the duration of the client-side application instance, i.e. it
      begins with the

      server request that renders the page, and ends e.g. when the browser tab
      is closed or F5 is

      pressed to reload the page.  Note that if the application's router
      supports in-place navigation

      (via the history.pushState() API), the application session persists across
      these transitions.

      A unique identifier used to correlate logging and other diagnostic
      information.  Whereas the

      applicationId tracks the entire lifetime of the client-side application
      instance, the

      pageId tracks an individual "page" that is rendered. For example, suppose
      that the

      application initially loads PageA, then the user does in-place navigation
      (via the history.pushState()

      API) to PageB, then navigates back to PageA, and finally they close the
      browser tab. During this

      sequence, the applicationId will remain the same, however the pageId will
      change on each

      navigation.  The 3 different pageId values are used by the diagnostics
      e.g. to track success/failure

      statistics for PageA independently of PageB.  The concept of a "page" is
      application-defined.
