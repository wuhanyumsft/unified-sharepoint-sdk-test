    summary: A callback that is invoked immediately before the dialog receives focus.
    syntax:
      content: () => boolean confirmOpen
      return:
        type:
          - () => boolean
    remarks: >-
      Provide this callback if there is a case when you want to abort showing
      the dialog before it's approved

      by the framework. For example, you can check if a long time has passed
      since the request was made or the

      the component requesting the dialog is disposed and you don't want to show
      the dialog anymore. It is

      important to keep this callback lightweight so the framework can resolve
      it quickly and the user interface

      does not have to wait a long time for it.
